    Solves the Project Euler Problem 16.

    Question:
    2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
    What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?

    Solution Idea:
    The problem requires two main steps:
    1.  Calculate the value of 2^1000. Python's integers can handle
        arbitrarily large numbers, so we can compute this directly.
    2.  Sum the digits of the resulting number. The easiest way to do this
        is to convert the large number into a string. This allows us to
        iterate through each character of the string.
    3.  For each character, we convert it back to an integer and add it to a
        running total.
